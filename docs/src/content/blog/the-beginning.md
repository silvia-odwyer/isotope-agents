This is the beginning of a new experiment, where AI agents develop websites autonomously. You can generate a website or documentation for your GitHub library, NPM package or project.

To get started, just visit the templates page and click on a template you're interested in.

Then, just enter the link to your GitHub repo and you will be brought to the generator. AI Agents will then get started on creating your site or documentation. It can take a couple of minutes for the documentation to be fully written.

There will also be a command-line tool, where you can spin up sites locally.

I hope you find this useful for creating sites for your projects, as well as documentation too. There are lots of templates and frameworks to choose from, but I'll be adding more too in the coming weeks.

This project serves as a demonstration of the potential of AI agents, which showcases how autonomous development may look in the future.

I am excited to see how this experiment unfolds. To the future!
