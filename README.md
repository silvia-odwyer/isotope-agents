# Isotope Agentic Web Development
## Get an AI Agent to Build A Website for Your Repo

Welcome! Here, you can ask an AI agent to build a website for your GitHub repository, NPM package or library.

With a web interface, you can generate full documentation sites and landing pages that detail your library or project's features.

## How Do I Get My Website?
There are different ways to generate sites:

1. **üåê Web interface**: Can be useful if you'd like to preview the results from the comfort of your web browser. See the links below.
2. **Open an issue**: Just open an issue here with a link to your repo and the template you'd like
3. **üíªCommand-line (coming soon)**: I am working on a command-line tool, which you can use to locally spin up your documentation and landing page sites.

To generate a site, just make sure that:
1. your repo is public (private repo support coming soon)
2. your repo has a README with info on your project 

...and that's it! With just one link to your repo, the AI agents will then get to work on building your site.

<!-- ### Command-line tool
Using the command-line tool, you can generate documentation for your sites locally. -->

### Web interface
A web interface is available, which contains full previews of all the templates that you can generate. You can also generate and preview the generated sites there.

Get started by clicking the links below (whether you'd like to create a landing page or documentation):

[Generate Landing Page](https://app.getisotope.com/generate?for=gh_repo_landing&template=lumeryxai)
[Generate Documentation](https://app.getisotope.com/generate?for=gh_repo_docs&framework=vitepress)

<!-- ### Opening an Issue
Simply open an issue here and provide a link to your open-source repo. Then, choose a template from the selection here.

You can export the results to HTML/CSS or Next.js. If there are any other edits you'd like to make, you can ask your assigned AI agent or the maintainer of this repo (who is human!). -->

<!-- ## Preview some sites generated
The sites below are fully-generated using Isotope's AI Agents about the [photon](https://github.com/silvia-odwyer/photon) open-source library:

^^^ Add yours above by submitting a PR. (Plus, a showcase gallery is coming soon, where you can showcase your generated pages.)

## Request New Website Templates/Designs
Have any ideas for new website themes or designs you'd like us to create? Let us know by creating an issue!

## How does it work?
This agentic flow is powered by isoagents, an AI agent framework I created for building websites and documentation sites. I will be working on adding new AI agents to this and will publish more details about this quite soon.

When you send a request to generate a website, a virtual sandbox is created, where AI agents can get started with building the website. In this sandbox, the agents can generate code, access the internet, write files to the filesystem and so forth. The resulting site is then zipped into a zip file, and you can download it via a link. Giving AI agents a sandbox to work within provides a more secure environment, giving the agents freedom to work on projects and autonomously build sites in a sandbox environment.

## How to Support Us
- **New templates**: We are looking for new designers! If you're a web designer and want to contribute new designs, just contact Silvia at the email: silvia [at] getisotope.com
- **Website requests**: Got a particular type of website you'd like to be built? We are hoping to expand our agentic AI web development capabilities and would love to help new developers with building websites.

<!-- ## Share Your New Website
Want to share your new website with your followers on social media? You'll also get a series of shareables you can use to quickly share to Twitter. -->

<!-- ## Stay up to date
Keep up-to-date on the latest updates by subscribing to our newsletter [here](https://getisotope.com/subscribe). -->

## New features on the way
These are the features that are in development:
- Auto-commits: Get an AI agent to auto-commit the changes and make a pull request to your repo
- Support for more documentation frameworks including Fumadocs
- Support for more static site generators including Zola and Hugo 
- Command-line tool

## Got Questions?
If you have further questions about this library, you can ask them on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/isotope-agents/community) or start a discussion here, and I'll get back to you!

If there are any issues involving setting up the websites etc, make sure to open an issue, it would be greatly appreciated, and will help improve the system.
